## Highlights

### 1. Reactive Forms

The project extensively utilizes Angular's Reactive Forms approach to handle complex form scenarios. Reactive forms provide a declarative approach to building forms in Angular, making it easier to manage and manipulate the form state.

### 2. Form Validation

Beneficiary Form POC includes robust form validation to ensure data accuracy and completeness. Leveraging Angular's built-in validators, the application ensures that users provide valid and required information during the form submission process.

### 3. Bootstrap Modal

To enhance the user interface, the project integrates Bootstrap modals for a sleek and responsive design. Modals are employed to display additional information, confirmation dialogs, or any other user interactions that benefit from a modal presentation.
